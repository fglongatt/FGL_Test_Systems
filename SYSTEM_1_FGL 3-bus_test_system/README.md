# SYSTEM 1.	FGL 3-bus test system
The SYSTEM 1 FGL 3-bus test system is a very simple but very used topology in academia. It consists of three buses with two synchronous generators and a lumped constant power load.
The system considers a single voltage level for simplicity in the manual calculations in classroom activities.
