# SYSTEM 10.	Stagg and El-Adiad test system [1]
The textbook Computer Methods in Power System Analysis [1] by Stagg and El-Abiad is a classic in electrical power engineering. The SYSTEM 10 is presented in Chapter 8 as an example of load flow calculations. Figure 8.8, page 284 in [1] shows the single-line diagram and Table 8.2 and Table 8.3 present the series impedances and granging for the transmission system and the schedule generation and loads, respectively. 
The test system consists of seven (07) transmission lines (with the capacitive susceptance included and modelled as a lumped PI model), the generator located in bus 2 operates in _PQ_ mode with P<sub>g3</sub> = 40 MW and Q<sub>g3</sub>  = 30 MVAr.
