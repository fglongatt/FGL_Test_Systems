# SYSTEM 7.	FGL 5-bus Test system considering capacitive susceptance (mesh)
The SYSTEM 7 FGL 7-bus test system is a very simple but very used topology in academia, it is used to show the _mesh_ topology, in this specific case, _ring topology_ in the transmission system. 
This test system consists of five buses interconnected in a ring topology using a single voltage level (115 kV), the transmission system considers the capacitive susceptance (_B_). The test system includes three (03) synchronous generators (G1, G3, G5), two fo them consider the reactive power output limits - -50≤Q<sub>g3</sub>≤ 50 MVAr, and -50≤Qg5≤ 50 MVAr- and three lumped constant power loads (Load 2, Load 3, Load 5). 
The system considers a single voltage level for simplicity in the manual calculations in classroom activities.
