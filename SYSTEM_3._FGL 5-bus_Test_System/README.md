# SYSTEM 3.	FGL 5-bus Test System
The SYSTEM 3 FGL 5-bus test system is a relatively simple topology but it can be used to introduce the concept of meshes transmission systems and the impact on the network modelling using the admittance matrix (**Ybus**). The transmission system considers the capacitive susceptance (B, nF/km), so the PI model (lumped parameters) is used to represent the transmission lines.
The test system consists of five buses with three synchronous generators (G1, G3 and G5), two of the generators are working to provide constant voltage. There are two lumped constant power loads. The system considers only one voltage level (115 kV) for simplicity in the manual calculations in classroom activities.
This test system helps to understand the use of the PI model of transmission lines and the complexity related to increasing the size fo the network.
