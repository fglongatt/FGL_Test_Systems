# SYSTEM 8.	FGL 6-bus test system
The SYSTEM 8 is an evolution of the SYSTEM 6. The evolution is adding a radial branch using a step-down transformer (bus 5 to bus 6) and an load.
This test system considers:
- The reactive power generation limits of the generators (Q<sub>g</sub>):  -40≤Q<sub>g3</sub>≤ 50 MVAr, and -40≤Q<sub>g5</sub>≤ 50 MVAr.
- The capacitive susceptance on the transmission lines (**B**) is neglected so the reactive power requirements and the stress on the system are increased, compared to the SYSTEM 5.
- A (01) static constant power load are added to the system (when compared to SYSTEM 6), Load 6 = 50 MW/7.5MVAr. The load is located in a radial branch with a step-down transformer (bus 5 and 6). So, the SYSTEM 8 is more loaded than the SYSTEM 6.
- An (01) additional fixed capacitive reactive compensation is added at bus 6: Q<sub>c6</sub> = 10 MVAR.
The test system consists of six (06) buses with three synchronous generators (G1, G3 and G5), two of the generators are working to provide constant voltage (G3 and G5) but the capacity to provide relative power is limited. There are five (05) lumped constant power loads (Load 2, Load 3, Load 4, Load 5 and Load 6). The system considers two voltage levels (115 kV and 34.5) for simplicity in the manual calculations in classroom activities.
