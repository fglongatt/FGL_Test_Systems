# SYSTEM 8.	FGL 6-bus test system
The SYSTEM 8 is an evolution of the SYSTEM 6. The evolution is adding a radial branch using a step-down transformer (bus 5 to bus 6) and an load.
This test system considers:
- The reactive power generation limits of the generators (Q<sub>g</sub>):  -40≤Q<sub>g3</sub>≤ 50 MVAr, and -40≤Q<sub>g5</sub>≤ 50 MVAr.
- The capacitive susceptance on the transmission lines (**B**) is neglected so the reactive power requirements and the stress on the system are increased, compared to the SYSTEM 5.
- Two (02) static constant power loads are added to the system (when compared to SYSTEM 5), Load 3 and Load 5. So, the SYSTEM 6 is more loaded than the SYSTEM 5.
- Three (03) fixed capacitive reactive power compensations are included in bus2, 3 and 4: Q<sub>c2</sub> = 50 MVAR Q<sub>c3</sub> = 100 MVAR, Q<sub>c4</sub> = 100 MVAR
The test system consists of five buses with three synchronous generators (G1, G3 and G5), two of the generators are working to provide constant voltage (G3 and G5) but the capacity to provide relative power is limited. There are four lumped constant power loads (Load 2 and Load 4). The system considers a single voltage level (115 kV) for simplicity in the manual calculations in classroom activities.
