# SYSTEM 9.	FGL 9-bus test system, considering automatic tap changer
The SYSTEM 9 FGL 9-bus tes system is representative of a small microgrid connected to a primary distribution grid (the external grid is connected at bus 1) with three levels of voltage (33, 11 and 3 kV). The lowest voltage level  (3.3 kV) is dedicated to small micro-generation (bus 7 and 8). Distributed generation is connected to buses 7 and 8, and they operate by controlling their terminal voltage with reactive power limits: 0≤Q<sub>g7</sub>≤0.22 MVAr and  0≤Q<sub>g8</sub>≤0.22 MVAr.
The test system consists of four (04) static constant power loads and five (05) primary overhead distribution lines in 11 kV (capacitive susceptance is neglected). The test system can be used to illustrate an academic case of a local grid-tie microgrid with automatic tap changers (something no commonly used in generation step-up transformers).
