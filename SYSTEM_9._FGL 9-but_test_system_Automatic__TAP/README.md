# SYSTEM 9.	FGL 9-bus test system, considering automatic tap changer
The SYSTEM 9 FGL 9-bus tes system is representative of a small microgrid connected to a primary distribution grid (the external grid is connected at bus 1) with three levels of voltage (33, 11 and 3 kV). The lowest voltage level  (3.3 kV) is dedicated to small micro-generation (bus 7 and 8). Distributed generation is connected to buses 7 and 8, and they operate by controlling their terminal voltage with reactive power limits: 0≤Q<sub>g7</sub>≤0.22 MVAr and  0≤Q<sub>g8</sub>≤0.22 MVAr
