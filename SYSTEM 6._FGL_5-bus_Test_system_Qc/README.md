# SYSTEM 6.	FGL 5-bus Test system considering reactive power compensation
The SYSTEM 6 FGL 5-bus test system is a clear evolution of the SYSTEM 5, it considers local and fixed reactive compensation (Q<sub>c</sub>)

it considers the reactive power generation limits of the generators (Q<sub>g</sub>), there is no capacitive susceptance on the transmission line (B), 


considering a relatively simple topology. SYSTEM 5 is an evolution of SYSTEM 4 by adding the capacitive susceptance (B) in the transmission lines of the system, so the transmission lines must be modelled using the PI model (lumped parameters). The test system consists of five buses with three synchronous generators (G1, G3 and G5), two of the generators are working to provide constant voltage (G3 and G5) but the capacity to provide relative power is limited: -40≤Qg3≤ 50 MVAr, and -40≤Qg5≤ 50 MVAr. There are two lumped constant power loads (Load 2 and Load 4). The system considers a single voltage level (115 kV) for simplicity in the manual calculations in classroom activities.
