# SYSTEM 2.	FGL 3-bus test system with TAP
The SYSTEM 2 FGL 3-bus test system with TAP is a very simple but very used topology but it can be used to introduce the concept of transformers with fixed tap.
The test system consists of three buses with two synchronous generators (G1 and G3), a lumped constant power load and two two-winding power transformers including a fixed tap. The system considers two voltage levels (115 kV and 34.5 kV) for simplicity in the manual calculations in classroom activities.
