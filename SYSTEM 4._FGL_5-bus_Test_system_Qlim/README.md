# SYSTEM 4.	FGL 5-bus Test system considering Q limits
The SYSTEM 4 FGL 5-bus test system considering the reactive power generation limits of the generators is a relatively simple topology but it can be used to introduce the use of generation controllers in the power flow solution. 
The test system consists of five buses with three synchronous generators (G1, G3 and G5), two of the generators are working to provide constant voltage (G3 and G5) but the capacity to provide relative power is limited: -40≤Q<sub>g3</sub>≤ 50 MVAr, and -40≤Qg3≤ 50 MVAr 

. There are two lumped constant power loads. The system considers only one voltage level (115 kV) for simplicity in the manual calculations in classroom activities. This test system helps to understand the use of the PI model of transmission lines and the complexity related to increasing the size fo the network.
